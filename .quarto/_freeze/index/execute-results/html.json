Trigger points can be extremely painful, limiting your range of motion and making it difficult to engage in daily activities.\n\n<span style=\"color: #AFABAB\">They often feel like small, hard nodules or knots underneath the skin or atop muscles, and they can cause pain either at the site or in a nearby area of the body. For example, a trigger point in your shoulder might not only cause direct soreness in your shoulder muscle, but could also result in a headache or arm pain. These points can form due to overuse, injury, stress, poor posture, or muscle imbalances.\n\n[Trigger point therapy is a massage therapy methodology that involves a targeted approach to relieve muscle tension and movement. It also alleviates exercise strain by reducing muscle soreness, improving bloodflow and accelerating recovery. It increases flexibility and range of motion, flushes out metabolic waste, and reduces inflammation, reducing in turn the risk of future injuries.]{style=\"color: #AFABAB\"}\n\n<br>\n\n### Half session: MYR 125\n\nHalf-hour.
