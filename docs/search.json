Trigger points can be extremely painful, limiting your range of motion and making it difficult to engage in daily activities.\nThey often feel like small, hard nodules or knots underneath the skin or atop muscles, and they can cause pain either at the site or in a nearby area of the body. For example, a trigger point in your shoulder might not only cause direct soreness in your shoulder muscle, but could also result in a headache or arm pain. These points can form due to overuse, injury, stress, poor posture, or muscle imbalances.\nTrigger point therapy is a massage therapy methodology that involves a targeted approach to relieve muscle tension and movement. It also alleviates exercise strain by reducing muscle soreness, improving bloodflow and accelerating recovery. It increases flexibility and range of motion, flushes out metabolic waste, and reduces inflammation, reducing in turn the risk of future injuries.\n\n\n\nHalf session: MYR 125\nHalf-hour. For single issues or preventative maintenance.\n\n\nFull works: MYR 250\n Full hour. Give your body a full tune up. Or for problems that are widespread or particularly complex.\n\nDiscounts available for the elderly, people with disabilities, manual labourers and migrant workers.\n\n\n  \n\nIntake form"
